Thanks for downloading 101 Artistic Noise Textures!

We recommend that you adjust the size and format of the included noise textures to better match your project settings, 
as the source files are large (2048) by default.

You can use these textures in many ways using shaders, but we've included a simple example shader to get you started.
Just create a new material using the "Alvios/NoiseFlow" shader, and use two different noise textures in the Main Texture and Distortion Texture slots.
Then you can modify the Distortion Speed/Size, Colors, as well as the tiling factors for the noise. 
Even with this single shader you can create countless interesting results!
